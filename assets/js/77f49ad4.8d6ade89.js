A timeline tracks our progress chronologically, with research activities flowing vertically in the main diagram. Following the o1 release, we progressed from initial evaluation and knowledge acquisition to team assembly and analysis. Our exploration then focused on four long thought construction attempts: (1) Propose-Critique Loop, (2) Tree Search with LLM and Reward, (3) Multi-Agent Approach, and (4) Complete Human Thought Documentation. The second attempt, our core exploration, splits into three tracks: Process-Level Reward Model, Construction of Reasoning Tree, and Integrating Reasoning Tree into Long Thought. These converge in an iterative cycle of model improvement, including both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The diagram's right side illustrates our training pipeline, featuring pre-training, iterative training, and optimization techniques. Solid black elements represent completed paths and milestones, while gray dashed elements indicate planned future explorations.
